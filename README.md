# FINALS LAB TASK 5
This activity includes filtering data with views, modifying records with stored procedures, and obtaining data with functions.

## Before coding, make sure to:
1.  Launch the MySQL Workbench and XAMPP and establish a connection. 
2.  You may try running each example using the hrd.sql file after opening the democodes.sql.
3.  Execute the necessary SQL statements following the practice codes.  Make use of inventory.sql.
4.  Print the relevant SQL and output for each item on the screen.
